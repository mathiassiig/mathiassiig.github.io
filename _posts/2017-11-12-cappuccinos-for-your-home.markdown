As with any other luxury-hobby in life, the more you get into the subject, the more aware you become of what is quality, and what is not.
The sense of quality takes time to perfect. But you'll also be investing money to achieve those high standards you will be setting for yourself. So what's a waste of money then? Today we're talking about coffee. Some claim it's a necessity, we call these people 'addicts'. Go another step up the luxury-ladder and you'll arrive at cappuccinos.

Coffee?
For the espresso itself, I find that there is no perfect answer. Most Italians will probably swear by a stovetop espresso maker for home use.
Personally I'm among the lazy people that enjoy capsule-coffee. Recycling is an issue with this type of stuff, but bottomline, do whatever makes you happy - don't actively be a dick to the environment. I threw a couple hundred capsules at a major coffee company the other day, but I'm concerned as to how exactly they recycle it, if at all. Anyway, I'm sure someone could write a whole rant about conventional coffee versus capsule coffee. Try drinking espresso from different sources and make up your mind about that - it's quite a personal thing. But we're gathered here today to dive into the milk part of the cappucino. I'm only going to talk about the frothers I have tried myself.

Vacuum, heat and spit it:
For a time I used the built-in frother on my capsule-machine. You pour the milk into a container, which the machine vacuums, heats up and shoots as a steady stream of foamy milk. The result you get looks sort of like a Pilsner Urquell, which is just too much cloudy foam for a cappuccino or latte. You'll get a nice milky moustache, maybe even an entire milk beard. It's not very good. You're then supposed to take off the container and throw it in the fridge. At some point you have to clean the thing, and it's a bit of a hassle if you don't have a dishwasher. The price varies whether you get a capsule machine with a built-in frother, or a seperate automatic frother. It is not as expensive as a steamer, which we'll talk about soon.

Heat it 'n' beat it:
This one's some more manual labour, for the milk itself at least. The milk goes into a jar, the jar gets heated by whatever means you prefer, e.g. a microwave. After heating the milk, you throw on the lid. The handle on the lid allows you to beat the milk, and you do so until reaching double volume. You then let the milk rest for a while. As you can probably tell by now, this is quite less lazy than the machine. The work pays off, and the milk frothing quality sure is better. It's still too cloudy and foamy, but it's better than the robot. Cleaning is still slightly annoying but less work than before-mentioned compartment. Another plus is that this is cheaper than buying an automatic frother. I got mine for about €20. There are other frothers similar to this one, like the hand-frother, but that's just even more manual labour, so I would really avoid getting one of those.

Steam it:
At some point you become snobby enough, and only the barista-level of quality sates your milk froth hunger. Actual baristas use rotatable steam nozzles and steel jugs.
The process is a little more complex than the others. There are three key parameters to perfectly frothed milk here: The rotation of the nozzle, the position of the jug and the temperature of the milk. The first two affect the last one. You rotate the jug in a specific way, start the nozzle with full throttle, and then move the jug so that the bottom comes closer to the tip of the nozzle. One hand clenches the handle of the jug, the other measures the temperature on the bottom of the jug. When it's too hot, you turn off the nozzle. Quite a mouth-full, but this whole thing takes less than ten seconds. Cleaning is very fast, as you just wipe down the nozzle and wash the jug. The downside? The price - it's around €200. I do not own one myself (yet), but I use one every day at work. There is something very satisfying about this machine, so if you're a total nerd like me, go for this.
